 create $tmpdir/phone_map.txt this has the format (on each line) <original phone> <version 1 of original phone> <version 2> ... where the versions depend on the position of the phone within a word. For instance, we'd have: AA AA_B AA_E AA_I AA_S for (B)egin, (E)nd, (I)nternal and (S)ingleton and in the case of silence SIL SIL SIL_B SIL_E SIL_I SIL_S [because SIL on its own is one of the variants; this is for when it doesn't  occur inside a word but as an option in the lexicon.]
